Assignment is to find a partner and FORK my repository, devide the work between two people, there are 13 todos over 5 files.
One of the students will create a repository but both students need to commit from their own account to this repository.

Learning objective:
1) devide and concor the tasks 
2) learn about the listview

if any students is left alone , he should join a group of two. I will allowe only one group of 3 students and no single student.
The code will not build successfully at this moment, you both need to figure out how does listview and adapters work.
